# Swarm and Kubernetes Wordsmith Demo

Wordsmith is the demo project shown at DockerCon EU 2017, where Docker announced that support for Kubernetes was coming to the Docker platform.

The demo app runs across three containers:

- [db](db/Dockerfile) - a Postgres database which stores words

- [api](api/Dockerfile) - a Java REST API which serves words read from the database

- [web](web/Dockerfile) - a Go web application which calls the API and builds words into sentences:

Static IPs set by default:
- `ucp` (UCP manager node): 172.28.128.31
- `dtr` (DTR replica): 172.28.128.34
- `worker-node1` (Worker node): 172.28.128.35
- `worker-node2` (Worker node): 172.28.128.36

## Build

The only requirement to build and run the app from source is Docker. Clone this repo and use Docker Compose to build all the images:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jeromebaude/k8s-wordsmith-demo
$ cd k8s-wordsmith-demo
$ git checkout update/container_to_kube
$ docker-compose build
```

Once your images are built, you can push them to your own repository (DTR)

```
$ docker login
$ docker push jeromebaude/k8s-wordsmith
```


## Deploy as a local Docker Stack

The latest version of [Docker for Mac/Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) has Swarm and Kubernetes built-in.

Docker lets you use the simple [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file format to deploy complex applications to Swarm and Kubernetes. You can deploy the wordsmith app to the local node using [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

First use `docker version` to check whether Docker is running with Swarm or Kubernetes - Docker for Mac/Windows supports both orchestrators **at the same time**:

```
$ docker version -f '{{ .Client.Orchestrator }}'
```

> You can switch orchestrators with the `DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR` environment variable, setting it to `kubernetes` or `swarm`. Docker for Mac/Windows Edge has both Kubernetes and Swarm support. Docker for Mac/Windows stable only supports Swarm

Create a local Swarm cluster
```
$ export DOCKER_ORCHESTRATOR=swarm
$ docker swarm init
```

Deploy the app to Swarm as a stack using the [compose file](docker-compose.yml):

```
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml words
```

Check that your stack runs the 3 services
```
$ docker services ls
ID                  NAME                MODE                REPLICAS            IMAGE                                  PORTS
jikom7jeuac7        wordsmith_api       replicated          5/5                 jeromebaude/k8s-wordsmith-api:latest
vx1p96ppgxvo        wordsmith_db        replicated          1/1                 jeromebaude/k8s-wordsmith-db:latest
gemz9w4f4su1        wordsmith_web       replicated          1/1                 jeromebaude/k8s-wordsmith-web:latest   *:8081->80/tcp
```

Then browse to http://localhost:8081 to see the site. Each time you refresh the page, you'll see a different sentence generated by the API calls.

What is the ID and IP adress displayed below each word? (Hint: You may want to use `docker ps` )

When you are done, you can remove your stack

```
docker stack rm wordsmith
```

## Deploy as a Docker Stack on a remote cluster

The development work is done. It is time to deploy on a UAT environment.

Login to ucp https://ucp.local and enter your user credentials. Go to `My Profile` and click on `New Client Bundle` `Generate Client Bundle`
Download the zip on your local labtop and unzip it and "source" your bundle

```
$ cd ucp-bundle-docker
$ eval "$(<env.sh)"
```   

Make sure you are now communicating with a remote cluster

```
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:	18.03.0-ce-rc4
 API version:	1.30 (downgraded from 1.37)
 Go version:	go1.9.4
 Git commit:	fbedb97
 Built:	Thu Mar 15 07:33:28 2018
 OS/Arch:	darwin/amd64
 Experimental:	true
 Orchestrator:	swarm

Server:
 Engine:
  Version:	ucp/3.0.0-beta2
  API version:	1.30 (minimum version 1.20)
  Go version:	go1.9.2
  Git commit:	4f665c3
  Built:	Tue Jan 16 21:38:10 UTC 2018
  OS/Arch:	linux/amd64
  Experimental:	false
```   
Make sure you are using swarm

```
$ docker version -f '{{ .Client.Orchestrator }}'
```
Deploy the app to Swarm as a stack using the [compose file](docker-compose.yml):

```
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml words
Creating network words_default
Creating service words_db
Creating service words_api
Creating service words_web
```

The UCP dashboard tells you have 6 services running

Click on `words_api`, check that you have 5/5 replicas and then click on `Inspect Resources`> `Containers`
You should now see the container IDs corresponding to the words_api service.

You can access the wordsmith web app on any node of the cluster on port 8081 (http://ucp:8081)  
Check that the container IDs which are displayed by the web application front end are correct.  

Question: Why can access our web app on any node of the cluster?

You can remove your stack

```
docker stack rm wordsmith
```





















## Deploy Using a Kubernetes Manifest

You can deploy the same app to Kubernetes using the [Kubernetes manifest](kube-deployment.yml). That describes the same application in terms of Kubernetes deployments, services and pod specifications.

First remove the Kubernetes stack:

```
docker stack rm wordsmith
```

> Alternatively You can leave the Docker stack deployment running, and create a second deployment in a new Kubernetes namespace.

Now apply the manifest using `kubectl`:

```
$ cd kube
$ kubectl apply -f .
deployment "api" created
service "api" created
deployment "db" created
service "db" created
deployment "web" created
service "web" created
```

This will create everything needed using one file per Service, ReplicaSet and Deployment.

```
$ kubectl get deploy,service,replicaset
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/api   5         5         5            5           2m
deploy/db    1         1         1            1           2m
deploy/web   1         1         1            1           2m

NAME             TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
svc/api          ClusterIP      None             <none>        8080/TCP         2m
svc/db           ClusterIP      None             <none>        5432/TCP         2m
svc/kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          1d
svc/web          LoadBalancer   10.109.140.172   <pending>     8081:32724/TCP   2m

NAME                DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/api-5f75c58954   5         5         5         2m
rs/db-675d6c6dd8    1         1         1         2m
rs/web-65b986cd86   1         1         1         2m
```


Now browse to http://localhost:8081 and you will see the same site.

To remove the service.

```
$ kubectl delete -f .
deployment "api" deleted
service "api" deleted
deployment "db" deleted
service "db" deleted
deployment "web" deleted
service "web" deleted
```
